# PDF-File-Merger
This is my personal project which is a simple desktop PDF file merger application written in Java. Currently, it has a very basic GUI :( developed using Swing and supports the following functionalities: 
    1) Add Files - allows users to choose and upload pdf file on their computers to merge into one pdf file
    2) Remove    - allows users to remove selected pdf files which they previously added to be merged with other pdf files
    3) Clear All - removes all uploaded pdf files that were added into program for purpose of merging them
    4) Merge     - merges all uploaded pdf files
    
My next steps to improve this project include improving the UI and making it into a broader app by adding more functionalities such as splitting PDF files, being able to edit PDF files, etc.
